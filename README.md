## 🐉 What is 0xRRYX?

0xRRYX is a **self-reflection tool**—part mirror, part flashlight—for neurodivergent and twice-exceptional (2e) minds.  
It is designed for gifted teens and adults who feel misaligned with the world around them.

It is **not** a diagnostic tool.  
It is a quiet companion for introspection—through questions, metaphors, and gentle resonance.
