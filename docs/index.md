# 🧠 Welcome to 0xRRYX

> A self-reflection tool for the misunderstood mind.

**0xRRYX** is a guided self-reflection tool built for neurodivergent and twice-exceptional (2e) minds—those who feel fast, deep, intense, and out-of-sync with the world.

It is not a diagnosis engine.  
It is not a productivity hack.  
It is a mirror, a flashlight, and a signal amplifier.

## 🎯 Who it's for

- Teens and adults who feel bright-but-stuck
- Suspected ADHD / ASD / dyslexia profiles
- Intense thinkers, emotionally deep, curious, intuitive
- Anyone who asks: “Why do I feel different?”

---

## 🛠 How it works

You’ll interact with 0xRRYX through an AI interface. It asks carefully structured questions in three phases:

1. **ND Resonance** — inner divergence and sensitivity
2. **NT Filter** — neurotypical alignment patterns
3. **High Potential** — deep, creative, pattern-linking cognition

Each instruction set is tuned to a different model (GPT, Claude, etc.).

## 🛰️ Signal ACK

If you find yourself reflected clearly here, you can echo back by sending a simple “ack” to:

📧 [0xrryx@gmail.com](mailto:0xrryx@gmail.com)

This is not required—but sometimes it's good to know the signal reached someone real.

**Explore. Reflect. Don’t rush.**

> You were never broken—just tuned to a different frequency.
